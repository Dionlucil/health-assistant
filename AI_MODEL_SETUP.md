# 🤖 AI Model Setup Complete!

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Fixed Template Error**
- Resolved the `UndefinedError: 'forms.SymptomForm object' has no attribute 'age'` error
- Updated `templates/symptoms.html` to properly handle age and gender fields
- Age and gender are now read-only fields that display user profile information

### 2. **Created Hugging Face Model Integration**
- **`models/`** folder created with complete AI model infrastructure
- **`huggingface_integration.py`** - Main integration module with fallback functionality
- **`download_model.py`** - Script to download and set up models
- **`requirements.txt`** - Dependencies for AI functionality
- **`README.md`** - Complete documentation

### 3. **Model Features**
- **Automatic Fallback**: Works even without external models
- **Lightweight**: Designed to avoid performance issues
- **Medical Focus**: Optimized for health-related analysis
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for existing code

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Current Status: Fallback Mode Active**
- The system is working with basic symptom analysis
- No external dependencies required
- Provides reliable symptom detection and basic recommendations

### **To Enable Full AI Model:**
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r models/requirements.txt`
2. Run: `cd models && python download_model.py`
3. The system will automatically use the downloaded model

### **Testing the Integration:**
```bash
python test_model.py
```
